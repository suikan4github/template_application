### Command line
Run the followings commands inside this directory ( Where README.md exists) : 
```Shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
The executables are stored in the subdirectories: 
- build/src
- build/test

In the case of MS Visual Studio C, the executables are located under the build configuration subdirectories like :
- build/src/Debug, build/src/Release
- build/test/Debug, build/test/Release

To run the Ctest, type :
```Shell
ctest
```

## Install
 
### Ubuntu
Run followings on the shell. 
```Shell
sudo snap install code --classic
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
```
- Note 1: After installing VS CODE, install the [C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack) to the VS CODE.
### Windows

Run followings on the PowerShell or Command . 
```PowerShell
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode -e
winget install Kitware.CMake -e
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.Community -e
winget install Git.Git -e
winget install Python.Python.3 -e
```
- Note 1: After installing VS CODE, install the [C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack) to the VS CODE.
- Note 2: The above winget install the CMake installer only. Run the CMake once and complete the installation.
- Note 3: The above wget install the VisualStudio launcher only. [Install the C++ workload](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170) after winget installation.

After the installation, set the PATH environment variable for CMake, Visual Studio C and Git. 

### WSL2

Run followings on the PowerShell or Command to install the Visual Studio CODE editor. 
```PowerShell
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode -e
```
Then, run followings on the Ubuntu shell. 
```Shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake ca-certificates
```
- Note 1: After installing VS CODE, install the [C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack) to the VS CODE.
